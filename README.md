# python-gmail
Search retrieve and send emails with gmail using python.

I mainly wrote this code to automate forwding emails to kids grandparents sent by daycare on a daily bases
You can have gmail fwd your emails but the recepients have to acknowledege approval which is a hassle when 
dealing with non tech people.
You can also have your favourite email client do this but, in this but I barely use mine so with this solution and cron am covered.
